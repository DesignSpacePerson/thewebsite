          <p>Competing in Hong Kong’s caffeine industry amidst hundreds of other coffee shops, Holly Brown Coffee Roasters tasked my team and I
            to develop a way for them to improve their place in the future. By taking advantage of IoT and the emerging prevalence of tech among
            students and working professionals alike (their target market), why not utilize futuristic solutions in their cafes today?</p>

        <h5>Problem</h5>
        <p>Hong Kong has a growing coffee culture, and with so many new coffee shops sprouting up in an already crowded space, figuratively and quite literally,
          businesses need a competitive edge to attract customers and afford the rising costs of rent. Holly Brown’s, a franchise cafe, needed a way
          to revitalize their brand and improve their build a larger customer base.
        </p>
      </div>

    <div class="row">
      <div class="col s12 m6 push-m3">
        <h5>My Role</h5>
        <p>I took part as one of the main UX Researchers and Prototyper for this international team. In my efforts to break through the language barriers (the rest
          of the team were Hong Kong locals), I sought to help out in all aspects of the design process, as well as in staging it at the end for a truly immersive experience.

        <h3>Seeking an Advantage</h3>
        <p>They needed a competitive edge; they were already quite well-known and so our approach was to prove their worth and improve the services they had to offer.
          My team created a more digitally connected system for their stores, with an Interactive “Smart” Table at the core of this plan, in order to promote their
          commitment to listening for areas of improvement whilst providing more value to their customers. I went and surveyed their staff as well as a few willing
          customers about what would attract them to visit Holly Brown's more:</p>
        &nbsp
        <h5>Business and User Goals</h5>
        <p>1. Attract and retain customers, in an effort to gain recurring business
          <br>
          <br>2. Improve the customer experience
          <br>
          <br>3. Provide more communication channels between staff and customer
          <br>
          <br>4. Utilize this as both a customer experience enhancement as well as a potential marketing tool
          <br>
          <br>5. Allow for ways to interact with their barista and seatmate(s)
          <br>
          <br>6. Make it both easy and enticing to use
        </p>
        <br><br>
        <h3>User Research</h3>
        <p>Observing customers and researching articles/trends on HK’s caffeine landscape came first. But it was equally as important to take note of the various
            behaviours of consumers within their space. By utilizing the AEIOU framework (Activities, Environment, Interactions, Observations, Users), I spent several hours inside, and right outside of, their Haysan Place Mall
            Location in order to get a better grasp of consumer behaviour.

        <p>After a few days of note taking, I requested to interview cashiers and servers as well as coffee drinkers (who were willing to). Doing so gave
          me a better understanding of their general reasons for being at cafe(s), and if/why they may have had a preference for Holly Brown's. This led
          to identifying Key Drivers that influenced stakeholders (staff and customers alike).

        <p>1. What/Who does the customer interact with before, during, and after the coffee buying experience

        <br>2. What services and activities does the cafe provide
        <br>
        <br>3. Where do the two converge? These would bring about which activities
        during the process provide a connection that we can improve. By identifying
        which are the most frequently used connections, we can find starting points to build off of.

          provide opportunities for staff to contribute to this.

          <br><br>It would be great if the cup can be scanned from anywhere on the table, but for feasibility purposes, there is a specific
          area that tells the user to “to place cup [t]here to activate”.

        <h3>Retrospective</h3>
        <p>Technology is almost there; although these and other IoT/Smart Digital devices are not yet considered mainstream,
          there will continue to be a growing market for it. Especially since students and young adults alike are often inhibited
          by the tech they are using.
        </p>
        <h5>Challenges</h5>
        <p>Understanding each other was our largest struggle. All the members of my team were born and raised in Hong Kong,
          and neither of us spoke the other’s language too well. This may have made it difficult to speak, but they were patient
          with me and I in turn made it a point to maximize my mastery of english to reach out to our stakeholders and international users.
          This opened up even more opportunities to explore further for this project than we otherwise would have been able to.
