          <p>Facilities management is one of BGIS’ core offerings. Due to growing demand, our previous IT leads were
            tasked to revamp BGIS Assist, our in-house application providing our clients and vendors with the ability
            to create and track tasks to manage their properties. Despite launching several months late and going over
            budget, the application was not only received poorly but was even rejected by some clients, especially as
            numerous contractual, usability, and accessibility requirements were not met.

            the end (lower down in this page)</b>
            <br><br>Armed with less than half of the time they had, much less than a quarter of their budget, and a
            string of dissatisfied clients, this is where I came in to properly see the project through.</p>

          <h5>Problem</h5>
          <p>Our clients were disappointed with the previous team’s app submission. With several complaints simultaneously
            sent our way, I immediately went out to ask what these problems were and break down what it would take for us to meet their needs:
            <br>
            <br>1. Failed Accessibility Tests based on AODA WCAG 2.0 Standards
            <br>
            <br>2. The app was not usable; there are 3 viewpoints to this (the clients, their users, and our business team),
            all who agree to this failure, but each of them  have different reasons for why they deem it unusable
            <br>
            <br>3. It was missing a separate admin controller
            <br>
            <br>Since the need for it was still very clear, the company decided to embark on getting this done right. Except this time,
            there was really no more for error.

          <h5>My Role</h5>
          <p>I was the Lead UX/UI Designer for this project, and partially the PM due to my request to align as best as possible
            with our clientele. I led 2 other designers and worked closely with our technical PM and dev lead. Due to time constraints,
            I balanced business/user alignment, strategy, and app presentation with designing the overall flows and hi-fidelity mobile+desktop screens.</p>

          <h3>No Room for Error</h3>
          <p>I immediately set out to clarify what the key goals were in order to ensure that our efforts were being utilized wisely.</p>
          &nbsp
          <h5>Key Landmarks for Success</h5>
          <p>Beginning late February, we were only given 4 months to design and 2 additional months for deployment and adjustments), as they
            were trying to meet the late summer July/August rush of work, I set out to clarify what “success” would mean for us:
            <br>
            <br>1. The first was to pass accessibility standards based off of North American Standards (which also included Section 508 requirements)
            <br>
            <br>2. The second was to make the application ‘stable’; thus this needed further UX vetting from the 3 parties to define what our basis
            was for stability and becoming usable
            <br>
            <br>3. Create an admin/management option. All of our clients were still using our current system [RealSuite] for this, but
            the high demand required us to have it as its own module
            <br>
            <br>I was tasked to focus on the app-side, meaning that the first two were priority and needed vetting, so I decided to test and clarify these requirements further.

        <div class="col s12 m6 push-m3">
          <h3>Testing to Clarify Direction</h3>
          <p>With a lean approach and an emphasis on working closely with our stakeholders, I was determined to maximize what little time we had.</p>
          <br>
          <h5>1. Checking for Accessibility</h5>
          <p>To pass accessibility standards, we first had to find out how we failed. My team and I audited everything in the current state
            to assess what needed design (and at times, technical) adjustments. We also worked with a third party to align with this audit

          <h5>2. Defining Usability</h5>
          <p>We requested for every available piece of written and recorded feedback, then asked what the user and business goals were out of using this app.
            Based on these, we requested that we have a focus group from them of either the business reps, trainers (often managers in
            charge of teaching the rest of their team the app/process) and actual users.
            <br><br>
            I also found the agreement to move away from providing training--however, clients ended up having to set up team-wide
            sessions on top of all of the complaints and inquiries they called in for.
            <br><br>
            I created tree diagrams from our current flows to help the audience visualize them and see if their goals are being met. If they
            were not, then they themselves can show me where the crux was for us to rethink through.

          <h5>3. New Admin Module</h5>
          <p>Clients were forced to subscribe to our in-house software, which was a more costly external tool for them to learn and keep track of
            (it was a different experience and no separation of work type). In order to create and access the tasks being assigned.
            <br><br>
            My PM and I spoke to our dev lead to ask if we can utilize the same database while keeping them in the same BGIS system: doing so would simply
            treat the application as a SaaS platform with varying levels of accounts to base their ability to use the app depending on their access.
            This costs less on them and means that they only need to get to know one application--if this didn’t significantly cost us more, it also
            meant that it would make it easier for us to segment and price out their workload to this one platform rather than have it intertwined with
            the rest of the module it was originally thrown in with.
            <br><br>
            This had accounting, usability, and business benefits. Furthermore the development costs may have been a little bit more but it leveraged
            the existing work we were placing on to the revamp, they just had to put some more effort into the security protocols to coincide with the architecture
            <br><br>As there was a desktop base that existed, but was only worked on halfway before being abandoned, I tried to build on that instead to save some time:

        <div class="col s12 m6 push-m3">
          <h3>Define, Ideate, Test and Repeat</h3>
          <p>Auditing helped us prove that while a lot of the UI and general usability needed revamping, we did not need to perform a complete overhaul
            of the app. However, I did need to be creative with testing as it was all done remotely.</p>
          <br>
          <p>1. This meant that after we dissected the pages & components we would adjust, we can begin to compare it w/ our branding guidelines and
            design system. The extra level of complexity is that the DS had a light base, while this build was much closer to a dark mode
          </p>
          <br><br>
          <p>2. Tree Testing led me to evaluate the usability and our screens. From here I needed to immediately define if it was even worth going
            into lo-fi, primarily because of our short deadline but mostly because we already had hi-fi available that could be adjusted and revamped,
            rather than spending our time on starting from scratch (if this is what made sense).
            <br><br>My hypothesis was right, not only because our clients did not want to start right from the beginning, but because the general flows
            made some sense; they just required optimizing as well as better instructional/helper functions along the way
          </p>

          <br>
          <p>3. As it was confirmed that leveraging the same database was doable, I set out to maximize our current user-focused app to create a
            management-based version of it to propose to the clients and define what kind of accounts we need aside from the users to perform their
            tasks. We defined that on top of the (1) user-side, we needed a (2) task assigner and a (3) management level user that can adjust these
            permissions (3 user account types in total). Hierarchically speaking, this simplified it to a top down approach that aligned with their
            management structures, how we would set up permission controls, and isolated pricing.

        <div class="col s12 m6 push-m3">
          <h3>Into the Thick of It - App Designs</h3>
          <p>We started out by making adjustments to the components, text, spacing, and base standards that we outlined would need updating regardless.
            We also compared with our Design System and branding guidelines.
            <br><br>
            While this was happening, I segmented the work to one designer looking into checking that these styling changes pass the accessibility
            requirements we set (AA to AAA when possible) while another focused on the icons and upgrade of a few of the base components. This allowed me
            to engage with the business as they confirmed my plans on how this would coincide within the same environment as the management portion.

          <p>When the app portion was submitted for development and deployment, my team spent the rest of our time, with the same process,
            for the desktop website/browser portion which is also where the management side resided. Because we were keen on evaluating our approach
            early on, our gamble paid off and we had a much clearer path to succeed with this project as both systems aligned with their (3) goals.
          <br><br>These are the desktop screens I designed:</p>

          <h3>A Successful, Pivotal Turnaround</h3>
          <p>More accessibility checks were performed, and thankfully due to our competent teamwork, they actually worked to our favour.
          <br><br>Here are some of the major results we accomplished within the first 60 days of gradual release:
          </p>
          <h5>The Results</h5>
          <p>a. Our major accessibility evaluations were performed by Deque (one of the top Accessibility companies who are active on the web
            committee writing accessibility standards and are in charge of aXe, one of the most popular web accessibility testing apps). On our
            final check, they not only confirmed our AA compliance but even commented on how we exceptionally showcased “never before seen results”
            as part of their praise for our efforts.
            <br><br>
            b. Both our leadership team as well as our clients were very pleased to see this, and it earned our team their confidence in us back.
            <br><br>
            c. With this, the clients that were in the midst of rejecting us gave immediate turnarounds and had this app integrated back into their teams’ systems
            <br><br>
            d. Upon release, there were calls about bugs here and there, but we had no requests, beyond one round, calling for training
            </p>
            <br><br>
          <h5>Exceeding expectations</h5>
            <p>Thanks to our incredible team, we were able to meet and surpass our targets:
            <br><br>
            a. Received a nearly perfect score on the accessibility checks (unprecedented but confirmed by the auditor) → Goal
            #1 was achieved
            <br><br>
            b. Clients were very pleased with the revamped design but didn’t feel alienated as if it was too large of an overhaul
            <br><br>
            c. Customers saved an estimated 80% on training costs (instead of 2+ sessions per new user). This was not only good
            value to them but also great for us because we were short-staffed on trainers with all of our other new products
            released and the company was moving away from the model needing to teach users. This made us to be more competitive
            and be able to offer this to a much wider market → this and reduction of general complaints (for the first 60-90 days) meant a success in goal #2
            <br><br>
            d. Fixing up Sign up/Account Setup/Forgot Password or Username were found to be major points for reducing those calls
            <br><br>
            e. With no need for App Store checks, we deployed the management accounts a little later but this was fine as clients and users were busy setting
            their teams up for the user-side → answered goal #3
            </p>
            <br><br>
            <h3>What this meant for UX/UI at BGIS</h3>
            <p> With the success of this launch, our leadership team relayed multiple benefits it would be embarking on thanks to
              this: Short term it is a stand-alone application with an interconnected database, long-term it can be introduced as
              part of our Suite of products in a more connected yet self-sufficient manner, as its capacity to be a stand-alone app
              is crucial to the short term.
              <br><br>
	             For my team, we were more so excited about how this project allowed us to build on our client relationships and
               continue on this iterative approach. We were able to establish more open communication within outside teams of
               the IT department, and found that there was work here (such as the Dark Mode) that can be further utilized.
               Most importantly, I have since been able to leverage our success here to implement better usability and
               accessibility standards throughout RealSuite, BGIS’ flagship product that I am currently leading design on.
               You can view my work for this in the next case study, Redesign RealSuite.
